# Mental Health App

This Mental Health App is designed to provide users with resources and tools to manage their mental health effectively. It leverages the latest web technologies including React and Vite for a responsive and dynamic user experience.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (v14.0 or later)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dhrumilp12/Mental-Health-Companion.git
   cd client
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   This will start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`.

4. **Build for production:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   This command compiles the application into static files for production deployment.

### Configuration

- Ensure you create a `.env` file in the root directory based on the `.env.example` file provided, adjusting the values as necessary to match your local environment and secret keys.

## Usage Examples

### Adding a New Component

To add a new component, create a new file within the `src/components` directory. For example:

**src/components/NewComponent.jsx**
```jsx
import React from 'react';

const NewComponent = () => {
    return <div>Hello, World!</div>;
};

export default NewComponent;
```

### Utilizing a Hook

If you have a custom hook in `src/hooks`, you can use it within components like so:

**src/hooks/useCustomHook.js**
```javascript
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const useCustomHook = () => {
    const [state, setState] = useState(null);

    useEffect(() => {
        // Perform actions
    }, []);

    return state;
};

export default useCustomHook;
```

**Using in a component:**
```jsx
import React from 'react';
import useCustomHook from './hooks/useCustomHook';

const ComponentUsingHook = () => {
    const data = useCustomHook();
    return <div>{data}</div>;
};
```

## Development Guidelines

- **Code Style**: Follow the ESLint rules specified in the project. Run `npm run lint` to check for code style issues.
- **Commit Messages**: Use concise and descriptive commit messages, following conventional commits guidelines.
- **Testing**: Write tests for new components and hooks using Jest and React Testing Library. Ensure all tests pass before pushing changes.
- **Documentation**: Update this README with any major changes, especially if adding new environments or external services.
